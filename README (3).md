### **Data science is using data to make better decisions with analysis for insight, statistics for causality, and machine learning for prediction.**
#
A Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organization’s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.

# Popular Python Libraries for Data Science:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn


# Task
1. Create a **Exploratory data analysis** on any Dataset of your choice. 
2. Find statistics and conclusion from the dataset like Trends, Future Outcome, etc.
2. Apply Data Visualization techniques to elaborate your conclusion.


  ### Some sample datasets [here](https://github.com/Git-For-Geeks/Data_Science_Tools/tree/main/Dataset)
  ### For more datasets: [Visit here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

  #### You can use any of the datasets but you should apply proper data visualization techniques that end up in finding the conclusion that can be drawn after visualizing the data. Mention the conclusion in your Collab or Python Notebooks.
